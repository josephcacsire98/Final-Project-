<h1>Java Page</h1>
<p> So for this page I had a bit of an issue I was supposed to go to use the Java and embed it in my text with HTML
but when I had done this the html would disappear completely. I left the source code in the program and the Java file I inteneded to implement is in my file. I just couldn't get it to work properly.</P>
