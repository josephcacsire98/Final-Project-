<h1>My Final Portfolio </h1>
<p> My name is Joseph Cacire and while taking this MWD 110 course I was able to learn so much
about coding I never thought I would. Down below are button links to everything I have learned throughout the semester
all linked up to this one page. Feel free to look through each one carefully, I did some amazing things which can be futher 
explained in the blog button of the portfolio. I had fun with this project.</P>
